    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's class will introduce you to functions in R. The notes are written in the Jupyter notebook in order to make things easier to run in class, but the same code is available in an R script in the course repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Today's Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the day is to become familiar with functions. We would like to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "1. Learn how a computer represents mathematical functions.\n",
    "2. Learn how a programmatic function works.\n",
    "3. Learn how to define our own functions.\n",
    "4. Learn about data types, function arguments, and namespaces.\n",
    "5. Learn how to nest functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If by the end of the class, you feel we haven't sufficiently covered one of these, speak up!\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Working Example : Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Monte Carlo is to approximate an integral by an average. If we take a random variable $X \\sim f(x)$ and draw a sample $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, then the following should hold:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}X = \\int x f(x) dx \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Maybe the distribution $f(\\cdot)$ is difficult to calculate or unknown, but we can still generate draws of $x_i$. In any case, we'll use this simple example as our working example for this class."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "That's it! That's all you need to know about functions... hopefully. We should have covered the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how a computer represents mathematical functions.\n",
    "2. Learn how a programmatic function works.\n",
    "3. Learn how to define our own functions.\n",
    "4. Learn about data types, function arguments, and namespaces.\n",
    "5. Learn how to nest functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose five of the functions we wrote and write documentation for them. You can either use the `roxygen` format or your own, but I need to understand what the function does, what its arguments mean/what their datatypes are, who made it, and when was it made.\n",
    "2. Re-run the above sets of simulations (for some set of `n`) and plot the results for the a uniform variable on $[0, 10]$.\n",
    "3. Create a function that calculates the inverse cdf of any random variable you would like. (If you don't have a favorite random variable, use  $X \\sim f(x) = 3x^2$... but don't forget to calculate the cdf!)\n",
    "2. Run a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the mean of the random variable from your answer to (3). Does your estimated solution match the theoretical value? **NOTE:** If you just copy and paste, there will be an error... it's up to you to track it down!\n",
    "3. Run a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the mean of a standard normal random variable, i.e. $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n",
    "4. Modify the above functions to estimate *any* moment by Monte Carlo."
